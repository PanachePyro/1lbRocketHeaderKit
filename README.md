# 1lbRocketHeaderKit
3D printed headers and tool kit for making 1-pound rockets (fireworks)

These STL files are for 3D printing pyrotechnic rockets
1 Pound Rockets
There are two types of geometric shapes. Both common in subsonic rockets
Ogive and Elliptical
The base jigs are not cross compatible

The funnel uses a 116x250 rubber O ring
When using the funnel it is very important that you TWIST IN - TWIST OUT
Do not insert or remove the funnel without twisting.
The O ring will keep the composition off of the sides of the header to protect from friction while inserting motor.
